## üõ† Tools and Requirements

- **Compiler:** g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **Operating System:** Linux

### Installation of g++
If g++ is not installed on your Linux system, you can install it using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install g++
```

### Running the Code
1. Navigate to the folder containing the `.cpp` file.
2. Compile the program using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ example.cpp -o example.exe
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./example.exe
   ```
