# Steps to write pseudocode:

---

1. Define the goal of the algorithm:
    What should it do? Example: Calculate the average of three numbers.

2. List the necessary steps:
    Think of a logical sequence to achieve the goal.

3. Use simple words:
    Avoid specific syntax of any programming language. Use expressions like "Read", "Display", "If", "End".

4. Keep it clear:
    Use indentation to show blocks of code, like in conditions and loops.

5. Test it mentally:
    Review to make sure the pseudocode works for different inputs.

## Example of pseudocode to calculate the average of three numbers:

```
    Start
        Display "Enter three numbers:"
        Read number1, number2, number3

        average ‚Üê (number1 + number2 + number3) / 3

        Display "The average is:", average
    End
```
